    		<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>The Molossian was designed as a way to deliver news about video games. It doesn't matter how old
			or new a game is as long as it's being talked about. Registered users have the added benefits of
			being able to add games and posts of their own to the website's database. Whether it's our staff or 
			the community updating The Molossian, you will never be behind on what's trending!</p>
